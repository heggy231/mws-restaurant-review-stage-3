### Functionality

#### User Interface
Users are able to mark a restaurant as a favorite, this toggle is visible in the application. A form is added to allow users to add their own reviews for a restaurant. Form submission works properly and adds a new review to the database.

#### Offline Use
The client application works offline. JSON responses are cached using the IndexedDB API. Any data previously accessed while connected is reachable while offline. User is able to add a review to a restaurant while offline and the review is sent to the server when connectivity is re-established.

### Responsive Design and Accessibility

#### Responsive Design
The application maintains a responsive design on mobile, tablet and desktop viewports. All new features are responsive, including the form to add a review and the control for marking a restaurant as a favorite.

#### Accessibility
The application retains accessibility features from the previous projects. Images have alternate text, the application uses appropriate focus management for navigation, and semantic elements and ARIA attributes are used correctly. Roles are correctly defined for all elements of the review form.

### Performance

_Location of server = /server_
Server depends on [node.js LTS Version: v6.11.2 ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [sails.js](http://sailsjs.com/)
Please make sure you have these installed before proceeding forward.

Great, you are ready to proceed forward; awesome!

Let's start with running commands in your terminal, known as command line interface (CLI)
